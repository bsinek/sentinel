# Sentinel

Sentinel is a quant research and experimentation platform for portfolio optimization, statistical arbitrage, and simulation-driven alpha discovery.

## Direction

The system will support:

- Monte Carlo simulation
- Brownian motion modeling
- Cointegration and stat arb research
- Portfolio optimization engines
- Neural network experimentation (later)

## Stack (planned)

- Backend: Django + DRF
- Compute: Python quant engine modules
- Orchestration: Celery + Redis
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Frontend: Next.js
